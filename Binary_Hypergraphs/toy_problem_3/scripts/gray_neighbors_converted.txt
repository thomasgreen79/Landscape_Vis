...seems that Complementary Crossover operator is, indeed, isomorphic to Single Bit Flip operator
with gray encoding function being the mapping from SBC to CX.

Yet, the steepest ascent networks of the two landscapes are very different, and number of optima
is not preserved.

What if I performed single bit flip on a Gray encoded landscape? (Do this - should show it to be same as CX operator landscape)



---IDEAS ABOUT ISOMORPHISM AND OPTIMA---
which means they are isomorphic, but optima would only be conserved on a problem that doesn't consider conversion of bits to another value, e.g. Onemax problem, Royal Road, etc.

when the representation of the bits correlates to values and those values matter for fitness, then the isomporphism would not, necessarily, preserve optima.
