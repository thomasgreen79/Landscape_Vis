The first trial for producing a SAN from a GA search did not do a very good job.
	-The connections in the network are any generated mutations from a parent population,
	so the results are not really related to the SAN, even if the general trend is
	toward the optima

	-An improvement would be to keep the connections between the individuals that are selected
	in the current population after every generation and their parents

	-Could still do even more to favor steepest ascent...
